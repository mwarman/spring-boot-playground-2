# Spring Boot Playground (2.x)

A Spring Boot playground project for Spring Boot 2.x

## How to use

### Prerequisites

This project requires Java 8 or later. It has been tested with Java 8 specifically to ensure compatibility, but should work with later versions.

### Run the application locally

Issue the following command in the project base directory to run the application locally.

```sh
./gradlew bootRun
```

The application starts, printing the log to the terminal console. The application may be accessed on base URL http://localhost:8080.

To stop the application, press `ctrl-C` (or `cmd-C` on a Mac).

### Package the application deployment

Issue the following command in the project base directory to package the application as an executable Jar.

```sh
./gradlew clean bootJar
```

The application is packaged as an executable Jar file, suitable for deployment to hosted environments. The Jar file is located in `./build/libs`, for example `./build/libs/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

The Jar may be executed with a command like `java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

### Testing

#### Endpoints

The application exposes a set of demonstration RESTful API endpoints which simulate standard CRUD operations on a `Todo` entity. The API endpoints are:

- `POST /api/todos` - Create a Todo
- `GET /api/todos` - List all Todos
- `GET /api/todos/{id}` - Get a single Todo by `id`
- `PUT /api/todos/{id}` - Update a Todo
- `DELETE /api/todos/{id}` - Delete a Todo

It is recommended that you use an API client such as Postman to exercise these endpoints. With Postman, you may import the OpenAPI specification (see below) rather than creating the endpoints manually.

#### API Docs

The application uses SpringDoc to generate both an interactive UI and an OpenAPI 3 specification.

The URL for the UI is: http://localhost:8080/api-docs/swagger-ui/index.html

The URL for the OpenAPI specification is: http://localhost:8080/api-docs

Adjust the base URL as needed when accessing the UI in hosted environments.
